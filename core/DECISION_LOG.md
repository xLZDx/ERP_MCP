## 2026-10-06 — Freeze E2E acceptance contract before product changes

- Decision: `docs/E2E_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md` freezes U01–U18 and A01–A54 (actor, action,
  expected, negative, evidence, class) before any product fix or E2E implementation, so the
  acceptance surface cannot move during implementation. Changes need a new plan amendment.
- Decision: tracked closing documents record `CODE_EVIDENCE_SHA` and local counts and mark hosted
  CI as pending; the exact final head SHA and hosted run IDs are recorded only in the PR #11
  body/comment (a tracked file cannot contain its own commit SHA or the CI run of that commit).
- Evidence: baseline with PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 locally: 1157 passed, 6 skipped (previous
  checkpoint: 39 skips). Remaining skips: 3 private-Ferma, 1 real-1C OData, 1 live-RSV (now run
  and passing locally), 1 native lifecycle (passes via `scripts.rsv_native_lifecycle_harness`).
- Refusal: RSV `reveal`, `execute_query` and generic business query stay disabled (documented
  privacy/company-scope/upstream-bound constraints are not remediated).
