# ERP_MCP decision / evidence log

Append-only. One dated entry per durable decision, evidence or refusal that future work needs.

## 2026-10-06 — Freeze E2E acceptance contract before product changes

- Decision: `docs/E2E_ACCEPTANCE_CONTRACT.md` freezes U01–U18 and A01–A54 (actor, action,
  expected, negative, evidence, class) before any product fix or E2E implementation, so the
  acceptance surface cannot move during implementation. Changes need a new plan amendment.
- Decision: tracked closing documents record `CODE_EVIDENCE_SHA` and local counts and mark hosted
  CI as pending; the exact final head SHA and hosted run IDs are recorded only in the PR #11
  body/comment (a tracked file cannot contain its own commit SHA or the CI run of that commit).
- Evidence: baseline with PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 locally: 1157 passed, 6 skipped (previous
  checkpoint: 39 skips). Remaining skips: 3 private-Ferma, 1 real-1C OData, 1 live-RSV (now run
  and passing locally), 1 native lifecycle (passes via `scripts.rsv_native_lifecycle_harness`).
- Refusal: RSV `reveal`, `execute_query` and generic business query stay disabled (documented
  privacy/company-scope/upstream-bound constraints are not remediated).

## 2026-10-06 - Disposable local E2E environment (branch e2e/local-environment)

- Decision: gateway, Fake1C and the test IdP run as host processes (uvicorn from the worktree
  venv); only PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 run in compose project `erpmcp-e2e`. Rationale: identical
  issuer/audience URLs for browser and gateway, trivial stop/start fault injection; the
  production gateway image is already built and scanned in CI.
- Decision: secrets are generated randomly once under the git-ignored `.e2e/`; the test IdP is
  the only place identities live. ERP_MCP gained no user-creation path and no 1C write path.
- Evidence: see docs/E2E_ENVIRONMENT.md and the commit history of this branch.

## 2026-10-07 - E2E test scaffolding

- Decision: tests/e2e is auto-skipped only when .e2e/env.json is absent and ERP_MCP_E2E_NO_SKIP is unset; scripts/e2e/test.ps1 sets it so a missing environment is an error.
- Evidence: 12 smoke tests green against the live environment (tests/e2e/test_smoke_environment.py).

- 2026-10-07 acceptance: clean up/status/smoke/reset/smoke/up/fault/down all executed; service launch changed to cmd.exe ShellExecute so callers reading output pipes do not hang. check_document_consistency reports a stale engineering checkpoint (implementation fingerprint covers scripts/tests/testbed); refresh is left to the integrator after merge.
